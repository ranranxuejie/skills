## 0. Academic Integrity and Source-of-Truth Rules

*   **Single Source of Truth**: All numeric values, benchmark names, dataset details, baselines, significance statements, figure/table references, and error bounds must come directly from Existing Material or explicitly grounded prior sections.
*   **Allowed Operations Only**: You may extract, restate, compare, regroup, or aggregate values already present in the source material. You may not invent, infer, smooth, interpolate, normalize, or silently revise any value.
*   **No Synthetic Evidence**: Do not add new experiments, new ablations, new subsets, new baselines, new statistical tests, new confidence intervals, new p-values, or new qualitative claims presented as measured facts.
*   **Missing Means Omit**: If a requested metric, subgroup, visual reference, or comparison is absent from the material, omit it instead of backfilling or guessing.
*   **Exact Preservation**: When a conclusion sentence reuses a result, preserve the exact direction, scale, unit, qualifier, and uncertainty stated in the source material.

## I. Cross-Domain Universal Underlying Logic and Framework Patterns

### 1. Narrative Logic Chain Breakdown: The Evidence Hierarchy

Top-tier Results sections universally follow a **"Hierarchical + Logical Flow"** structure, moving from primary findings to supporting evidence. The structure aligns with the hypotheses established in the Introduction and the methods defined in the Methods section:

| Order | Functional Module | Proportion | Core Writing Goal | Typical Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Participant/Subject Flow & Baseline** | 10-15% | Establish the study population and confirm comparability. | Recruitment numbers, exclusions, demographic tables, baseline characteristics. |
| **2** | **Primary Outcome/Main Finding** | 40-50% | Directly answer the primary research question/hypothesis. | Main effect sizes, key performance metrics, primary statistical tests. |
| **3** | **Secondary Outcomes/Supporting Evidence** | 20-25% | Provide additional context or corroborating data. | Secondary endpoints, complementary experiments, additional metrics. |
| **4** | **Subgroup/Sensitivity Analyses** | 15-20% | Demonstrate robustness and explore heterogeneity. | Stratified analyses, robustness checks, ablation studies (CS). |
| **5** | **Safety/Adverse Events (If applicable)** | 5-10% | Report harms or negative findings (Critical for Clinical/Engineering). | Side effects, failure rates, error bounds. |

### 2. Core Functional Module Division

*   **Essential Information**:
    *   **Exact Numbers**: N counts, percentages, means, standard deviations, confidence intervals.
    *   **Statistical Metrics**: Exact p-values (e.g., p=0.032), test statistics (t, F, χ² values), effect sizes (Cohen's d, OR, HR).
    *   **Figure/Table References**: Explicit pointers to visual data (e.g., "Figure 1A", "Table 2").
    *   **Direction of Effect**: Clear statement of increase, decrease, or no difference.
    *   **Missing Data**: Acknowledgment of missing data points or exclusions during analysis.

*   **Absolute Taboos**:
    *   **Interpretation**: Do not explain *why* the result occurred (save for Discussion).
    *   **Literature Comparison**: Do not compare results with other studies (save for Discussion).
    *   **Methodological Details**: Do not describe *how* the measurement was done (save for Methods).
    *   **Raw Data Dumping**: Do not list every single data point; summarize using statistics.
    *   **Selective Reporting**: Do not hide non-significant or negative results that were pre-specified.

### 3. General Language and Narrative Norms

*   **Tense Selection**:
    *   **Findings Observed**: Simple Past ("Group A *showed*...", "The model *achieved*...").
    *   **Figure/Table Content**: Simple Present ("Figure 1 *shows*...", "Table 2 *summarizes*...").
    *   **General Truths from Data**: Simple Present ("These data *suggest*..." - use sparingly).

*   **Voice Preference**:
    *   **Active Voice**: Increasingly preferred for clarity ("We *observed*...", "The treatment *reduced*...").
    *   **Passive Voice**: Used for emphasis on the object ("Significant differences *were found*...").
    *   **Consistency**: Maintain consistent voice within paragraphs.

*   **Structural Norms**:
    *   **Subheadings**: Use descriptive subheadings matching the research questions or methods.
    *   **Paragraph Structure**: One key finding per paragraph; start with the main takeaway.
    *   **Logical Flow**: Follow the order of methods -> primary outcome -> secondary -> robustness.
    *   **Text-Figure Integration**: Text should narrate the story; figures should provide the evidence. Do not simply repeat figure captions.

### 3. Rigorous Wording Norms

*   **Prohibited Absolute/Interpretive Statements**:
    *   ❌ "proves" → ✅ "demonstrates", "shows", "indicates".
    *   ❌ "clearly shows" (Subjective) → ✅ "shows" (Objective).
    *   ❌ "interesting ly" (Subjective) → ✅ Remove adverb.
    *   ❌ "better" (Vague) → ✅ "higher accuracy", "lower error".

*   **Compliant Precision Paradigms**:
    *   **Exact P-values**: Report exact p-values (e.g., p=0.032) rather than thresholds (p<0.05) unless p<0.001.
    *   **Confidence Intervals**: Always report 95% CI for effect sizes in clinical/observational studies.
    *   **Units**: Always include standard units (e.g., mg/dL, ms, %).
    *   **N-numbers**: Explicitly state 'n' for every experiment/data point cluster.

*   **Handling Null/Negative Results**:

    *   "The trend was in the expected direction but did not reach significance..."
    *   "Contrary to our hypothesis, X did not influence Y..."


## VI. Data Visualization & Text Integration Guidelines

### 1. Text-Figure Complementarity

*   **Text Role**: Narrate the story, highlight key comparisons, state statistical significance.
*   **Figure Role**: Display patterns, distributions, trends, and raw data density.
*   **Rule**: Do not duplicate. If a table lists all values, the text should summarize the trend.
*   **Example**:
    *   *Bad*: "Group A was 10.5, Group B was 12.3, Group C was 11.1 (Table 1)."
    *   *Good*: "Group B showed the highest values, significantly exceeding Group A (p=0.02; Table 1)."

### 2. Supplementary Material Usage

*   **Main Text**: Reserved for primary outcomes and key secondary outcomes supporting the main claim.
*   **Supplementary**: Reserved for extensive robustness checks, additional subgroup analyses, raw data tables, and negative controls.
*   **Referencing**: "See Supplementary Figures S1-S5 for additional sensitivity analyses."
*   **Consistency**: Supplementary results must not contradict main text results.
